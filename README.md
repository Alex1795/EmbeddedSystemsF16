# EmbeddedSystemsF16
Final project for my embedded systems class that I took on Fall 2016

This is the final project for ECE362 in Purdue. a digital implementation of the popular Musical Chairs
The project 'Game of chairs' is a multiplayer game in which each player has a color on the circle.
Each player can move his/her color one space at a time using the controller. 
Two players can never be in the same spor at the same time, not jump over other player.
The objective of the game is to be aligned with one of the active 'chairs' (central jumbo LEDs) when the timer stops.
Every time a player looses it is eliminated. when only one player remains in the game, that player is declared 'The new king'.

The inicializations of the microcontroller were implemented by Alejandro Tejada
The PCB for the project was done by Rodolfo Leiva
The software was developed by Mateo Vasquez and me.
